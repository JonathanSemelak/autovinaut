# BindForge
A modular pipeline for flexible-receptor molecular docking, clustering, and pose selection using AutoDock Vina.

It supports flexible residue definition around cofactors (e.g. heme), automated ligand translation, multi-run ensemble docking, and RMSD-based clustering to extract representative poses.
Designed for mutant–ligand screening, BindForge is built to evolve into a full binding free energy platform with classical and machine learning–based scoring.
